* Improv is a **team sport**. Our goal is **not** to be the funniest, but to try and make our whole team look good.
* The most important thing is to **have fun**. If you are having fun, the audience will too.
* **Agreeing** and **supporting** are the easiest ways to get on the same page. "Yes, and" your partner's choices!
* **Embrace failure**. If you're not failing, you're doing it wrong!
* We don't need to **invent** things. We just need to **react**.
* Questions can make it harder to move the scene forward. **Always** choose to **know** what's going on in a scene.
* **Bring a brick, not a cathedral!**
* If you didn't hear what someone said, it's okay to ask them to repeat it. If you didn't hear it, your character didn't either!
