[[Week 1]]

## Relationships
**Emotions** — feeling something about something.
	It's less about the action than the people involved. It's about vulnerability.

### The Big Emotions
1. Glad
2. Sad
3. Mad
4. Afraid

Smaller emotions, like boredom or indifference are harder, because there are less obvious feelings to explore.

**Relationships** — feeling something about someone.
**Emotional Statement** — how a character feels about something.

## Initiation
First line of the scene.
Watch what happens! It doesn't have to be perfect.
JUST MAKE A CHOICE.

## Arguments
Avoid. They crush the scene into proving who is right. Hard to navigate when feelings are involved. See [[Fight Well]]

## Characters
**Character** — the personality we bright to life.
	Not how we play them, but **why** they're like this.

They have emotions. They have **physicality** — how they move/behave.

**Commit** — feel believable. This character believes in their own reality. Commit to the choices pertaining to that.
	You only need to make **one choice**, and that will help you find the rest.

## Gifting
**Gifting** — when you give your scene partner an aspect of their character.
	Try to react to the last thing said and how if makes your character feel.
